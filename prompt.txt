I have an article written in British English that needs to be proofread for grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors. Please review the entire text and mark any errors you find. Use the following markup style for corrections:
Highlight each error in bold, red HTML text. For example, if the original text has 'teh', you should mark it as <b style='color:red;'>teh</b>.
Immediately after the marked error, provide the correct form in bold, green HTML text in brackets. For example, the correction for 'teh' should be <b style='color:green;'>(the)</b>.
Ensure that you reproduce the original text accurately and do not introduce errors and then correct them. Your output should only include the original article text with the specified markup for errors and corrections. No additional explanations or comments are needed either at the start or end. If the error that you spot and the correction appear to be identical, do not include that in our output. For example, This <b style='color:red;'>[study]</b> <b style='color:green;'>(study)</b> was very valuable is wrong because the supposed error and the correction are identical. Do not worry about capitalisation errors such as west and West.
